I want to build a travel planner AI agent using Langchain. Following are the steps of implementation
I would use gemini-1.5-flash chat model.
My agent needs to plan a trip so it needs access to the following tools. Each tool should be a python function and use open source APIs to fetch data
search_places(city)
get_weather(city)
find_hotels(city)
suggest_itinerary(city, days)
Use Langchainâ€™s Agent and Agent Executor module, connect my planner LLM + executor + tools
Define a good prompt to get the detailed itinerary considering the weather conditions and suggest other important things related to the place as well.
Return the final response
And make sure to create a virtual environment and a requirement.txt file .
